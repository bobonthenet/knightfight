# Knight Fight
## A simple platformer Knight Fighting Game

### How to play
You can play the current work in progress version of Knight Fight by visiting http://www.knightfight.bobonthenet.com/ use your keyboard arrow control keys to move right or left, space to jump and Z to attack.  Or if you like you can clone the game and run it on your own server.  Just be sure to give credit to the other content creators and myself if you share it with others.

## Development Plan
The to do list below is an approximate roadmap for the development of Knight Fight.  I will mostly be completing these in order but I might do something later in the list first if it seems easier, it makes more sense at the time or I just feel like it.  For the most part though expect the first thing on the list to be completed before the last.  As I think of new features or functionality I want to add to the game I'll add it to the list below and remove things as I complete them.

### TO DO:
* Fix bug that causes enemies to keep making noise after they die.
* Fix the hold the attack button sword bug.
* Fix the bug where you can win the game and then die.
* Fix bug that causes you to get stuck after the first hill.
