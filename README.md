# Knight Fight
## A simple platformer Knight Fighting Game

### How to play
You can play the current work in progress version of Knight Fight by visiting http://www.knightfight.bobonthenet.com/ use your keyboard arrow control keys to move right or left, space to jump and Z to attack.  Or if you like you can clone the game and run it on your own server.  Just be sure to give credit to the other content creators and myself if you share it with others.

## Development Plan
Knight Fight is now complete.  There are a couple of bugs remaining but unless someone finds something major I probably won't fix them.  This is because I want to get started on Knight Fight II! Knight Fight II will be a complete code rewrite of this game using everything I learned from Knight Fight I.  I'll also add some new enemies and a new game map just to really keep things interesting.

### TO DO:
* Fix the hold the attack button sword bug.
* Fix bug that causes you to get stuck after the first hill.
