# Knight Fight
## A simple platformer Knight Fighting Game

### How to play
You can play the current work in progress version of Knight Fight by visiting http://www.knightfight.bobonthenet.com/ use your keyboard arrow control keys to move right or left, space to jump and Z to attack.  Or if you like you can clone the game and run it on your own server.  Just be sure to give credit to the other content creators and myself if you share it with others.

## Development Plan
The to do list below is an approximate roadmap for the development of Knight Fight.  I will mostly be completing these in order but I might do something later in the list first if it seems easier, it makes more sense at the time or I just feel like it.  For the most part though expect the first thing on the list to be completed before the last.  As I think of new features or functionality I want to add to the game I'll add it to the list below and remove things as I complete them.

### TO DO:
* ~~Attacking bats does damage but does not necessarily kill unless hitpoints drop to 0.~~
* Bats do damagage to player.
* ~~Knockback~~
* ~~Show damage as floating numbers.~~
* Add more enemies.
* Sound F/X
* Music
* Redo map something more interesting.
* Title/load screen
* End screen with credits or something
* Secret mode with blood turned on.
* Mobile controls
